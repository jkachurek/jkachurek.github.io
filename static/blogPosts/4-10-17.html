	Last week I addeed one of my favorite recent side projects to my webpage:
	<a href="/cultSim">Cult Simulator</a>. It is an incremental/clicker game based
	on the idea of creating your own cult and expanding your reach. This was a pretty
	fun and silly project, but it taught me tons about TypeScript and JavaScript
	because of the logic required to properly run the game. I'll write out a few
	posts detailing my process of developing it, and I will try to continue writing
	about it as it gets fleshed out more. In its current form, it is playable, but
	lacks any sense of game balance, and, subsequently, any incentive to continue
	playing. Regardless, what I have written thus far is essentially a game engine
	for clicker games in TypeScript.
</p>
<p>
	My first step was to look at other prominent web clicker games to see how their
	creators planned them out and built them. The three main influences on this project
	were <a href="http://candybox2.net" target="_blank">Candy Box 2</a>,
	<a href="http://clickingbad.nullism.com" target="_blank">Clicking Bad</a>,
	and <a href="http://swarmsim.github.io" target="_blank">Swarm Simulator</a>.
	Clicking Bad and Swarm Simulator are certainly the biggest influences due to the
	key game mechanics being very similar, but the source code of Candy Box 2 proved
	very useful because it was also written in TypeScript. And though I did draw a lot
	from these games, I chose to build the game very differently in order to make it
	work in a very flexible way.  In this way, it does feel more like I have built a
	small game engine rather than just the game itself.  If I wanted to create another
	incremental/clicker game with another theme, the basic code at the core of
	Cult Simulator could be used to get it started.

<p>
	Keep an eye out on the blog, as I plan to go through how I developed Cult Simulator
	to its current point over the course of a few posts, and then I'll keep it updated
	as I expand the game even further.
