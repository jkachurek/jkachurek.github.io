	This is my first post on the blog section of my page!  Rather than using existing tools
	or libraries like Jekyll to create a blog on a site hosted by GitHub Pages, I decided GitHub
	would be an interesting challenge to do it using the same system I have for the rest of my site:
	TypeScript and Angular 1.  As you can see in the <a href="https://github.com/jkachurek/jkachurek.github.io">
	source code</a> for this website, most of the data rendered on the pages is stored in data files in each
	component folder.  While I would store the data in a different place for a larger application that
	requires more security, for a static website, this solution works just fine.

	My first concern when I considered building a blog page was how to render HTML directly to the page.
	This is not something you would typically do on a regular site with a backend that can securely render
	HTML forr you, since it can present severe security risks.  My first instinct to avoid this pitfall was
	to store the body content of each blog post as a separate HTML template, then render those dynamically
	using ng-include to reference the template's location.  Because I wanted to keep everything in the same
	place, I decided to instead just type the HTML of the body directly into the blog post models as
	properties, which would then be rendered.  Initially, I also thought about simply storing the blog
	content as an array of paragraphs, which would be rendered through an <code>ng-repeat</code>, but then
	realized that would prevent me from having anything	<em>other</em> than text in my blog posts.

	For now, I have landed on using Angular's <code>$sce</code> (strict contextual escaping) service to
	indicate that the HTML being loaded is trustworthy, since my site does not contain any user input or
	private information.  Though this is not my ideal solution, it works for the time being.  In the future,
	I plan to explore a few different things for this.  First, I might just migrate to storing body
	content in separate .html files anyway, for the sake of ease of writing.  Second, I might try to see
	if it is possible to return the template from a function when declaring the component.  Finally,
	someday, I might even move this thing into another framework, like Angular 2 or React.  I know for a
	fact that the latter would almost completely solve this problem.
