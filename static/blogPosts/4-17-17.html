	When I first approached Cult Simulator, I was thinking of making the engine for it quick &amp;
	dirty using JavaScript. I planned to create a couple object prototypes and then store all of
	the game data in JSON. But rather than wrangling what would become very long, unwieldy JSON files,
	I decided to start writing the game in TypeScript. My past experience with TypeScript was
	limited almost completely to my bits of work using Angular 2, so I had never used it for
	anything other than controller logic. Before worrying about all the data in the game, I took my
	first steps by working on the core infrastructure that would make the thing tick (literally).
	The first few pieces I made for the project were files that defined settings, player
	data/stats, resources, game items, and the game instance.
</p>
<p>
	I wrote <code>GameSettings</code> as a simple constant object that would contain various values
	affecting the way the game runs. The first value I added, for example, was the factor by which
	the cost of an item would increase after being purchased. It has grown to include how often
	the game updates and the amount gained by clicking a resource button.
</p>
<p>
	Initially, the <code>PlayerData</code> class only contained objects that would hold values
	related to player inventory. I will explain more on my initial game update method in a future
	post, but it revolved around the values in the player's data.
</p>
<p>
	The more interesting initial code that I wrote for the game involved resources. First, I defined
	a base class, <code>ResourceUsage</code>, which is basically just a key value pair of a
	resource name and an amount. I then defined a few other classes that extended it:
	<code>Cost</code>, <code>UnitCost</code>, <code>Generator</code>, and <code>Multiplier</code>.
	<code>Cost</code> and <code>UnitCost</code> implement an interface, <code>ICost</code>,
	so we can buy things in a very uniform way.
</p>
<p>
	The <code>ICost</code> interface states that any Cost must be able to be checked for its
	affordability, spent, and then increased by a factor (by default, the factor defined in the
	game settings). This is important because a default Cost will subtract from a player's
	resources, whereas a Unit Cost will deplete the player's inventory. Similarly, Generators and
	Multipliers were defined separately because they added to different properties of the player's
	data. A while later, through significant refactoring, I wound up streamlining this process to
	make it more extensible, but this was a solid start for the project.

	Be sure to keep an eye out for my next post, where I will explain the logic behind my first
	attempt at the game's update methods!
