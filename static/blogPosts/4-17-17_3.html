	I won't usually try to be clever in post titles, but this one was too easy. In this post about
	my development of the Cult Simulator game, I will detail how I moved from my initial system for
	updating the game and managing game items to the current system. I previously discussed the
	pitfalls of the initial system and what I attempted to do with my overhaul, so here you will see
	that process explained. One of the first, biggest changes I made was after the realization that
	any game item's effects can ostensibly be divided into two categories: Costs and Benefits.
</p>
<p>
	Costs are used when an item is purchased, whereas Benefits can take many forms and positively
	affect the player in multiple ways. Benefits can be one-time or continuous. They might be
	calculated every tick (which occurs more than once per second) or on a fixed update every second.
	They can give you lump sums, generate resources for you, recruit other units, amplify your powers,
	and more. The diversity of effects for Benefits led me to the conclusion that I had to make two
	main interfaces for game item effects: <code>ICost</code> (which already existed) and
	<code>IBenefit</code>.
</p>
<p>
	As before, the <code>ICost</code> interface defines that we have to be able to calculate the
	affordability of an individual cost as well as spend and modify that cost. This makes it easy to
	check a game item's affordability; though one item might require multiple types of units
	and/or resources, each item simply contains an array of <code>ICost</code>. We can therefore
	calculate	affordability by calling:
	<pre>item.isAffordable = item.cost.reduce((aff, c) => {return aff && c.isAffordable()}, true)</pre>
	Likewise, the item's costs can all be applied to the player's inventory/resources by simply
	calling <code>spend()</code> in a <code>forEach()</code> of the costs.
</p>
<p>
	Where I formerly had completely separate classes for various benefits (which all still inherited from
	<code>ResourceUsage</code>), I decided that an <code>IBenefit</code> interface would make adding and
	removing these benefits much less repetitive, and would make it much easier to add new types of
	benefits in the future. The basic <code>IBenefit</code> interface only requires two methods:
	<code>add()</code> and <code>remove()</code>. This is to accommodate Benefits which might not trigger
	every tick, for example a static increase in the player's Influence. For benefits that <em>do</em>
	trigger every tick, I created the <code>Tickable</code> interface. In the future, I might split these
	into <code>IStaticBenefit</code> and <code>ITickableBenefit</code>, since some tickable benefits
	do not need to be added or removed. But for now I have chosen to leave that functionality in case I
	find myself needing it down the line.
</p>
<p>
	The major advantage to making all benefits derive from the <code>IBenefit</code> interface is that
	when an item is purchased, we can simply call:
	<pre>item.benefits.forEach(b => b.add());</pre>
	...And vice versa for when an item is removed from the inventory.
	It follows that every tick, we will call:
	<pre>item.tickables.forEach(t => t.tick());</pre>
</p>
<p>
	One of the other major changes that I made in this transition was tracking the amount of each item
	that the player owns <em>within the item object itself</em>. In doing so, we can simply multiply
	each item's tickable effects by a factor that includes any multipliers and the number of that item
	owned. This made it possible to create much more complex types of Benefits, for example a
	building that increases the productivity of all Business units by 5%.

	As I continue this series on Cult Simulator, I'll talk more about how I set up game data, and
	item unlocks, so check the website often for more updates.
