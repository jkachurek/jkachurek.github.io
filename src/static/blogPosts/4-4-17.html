	The idea of rendering raw HTML frustrated me enough that I decided to ditch it and move to separate HTML
	templates. Unfortunately, this also meant getting rid of the embedded image solution that I had developed.
	If you missed my previous post, check it out to see my explanation of that method. In the future, if I
	have many posts with several images, I might migrate each blog post to have its own directory to make it
	easier to keep track of the images.

	The first thing I decided to do to make this transition was to change the way I access data that is
	displayed across my website. The <code>/app</code> folder and its subdirectories were starting to
	get crowded anyway with files holding the data, so I started migrating it all to a <code>/data</code>
	folder. Even though this is just a small personal website, I thought it could be a fun experiment
	to try simulating a sort of "layered architecture" on the front end. Obviously it lacks the actual
	security of layered architecture, but it was still an interesting project to do with TypeScript.

	So, I set about creating a slight twist on the generic repository pattern. Unlike many generic
	repository implementations, I am not using units of work.  For each page of my site that contains
	a list of items (so every major page, at this point), I create a "database" of the items using
	object initializers, assign all of the objects IDs, then create a new instance of a generic
	repository using that database.
</p>
<p>
	While I will never practically need to sort all of my resume experience by different properties,
	or retrieve one specific project in my portfolio by an ID number, it was fun to see that I could
	pull this off with relative ease in TypeScript.  A long while ago while working on my Cult
	Simulator incremental game, which is also made in TS, I encountered an error due to circular
	dependencies on the data.  So having a secure, controlled method of accessing data like this
	can indeed prove useful, even in a static page.
</p>
<p>
	Some might even question my choice of using object initializers to create models that will be
	displayed as static text, but I find it easier than worrying about misspelling something in a
	JSON file and having things load incorrectly.  This way, I can enforce consistency across
	an application and, thanks to TypeScript and the great IntelliSense in Visual Studio Code,
	I can have a much better idea of what I am doing when I write the code for angular controllers
	to manipulate those pieces of data.
</p>
<p>
	Changing the blog inspired me to try the repository pattern because I figured if I wanted to
	have a static blog, I would want easy ways to view single posts, filter by tags, etc. This
	implementation makes all of that possible.  My current goal is to implement my own solution
	for showing previews of blog posts, then showing the full thing when you click on it.  I
	will also discuss more about changes made in recent days in my next post,
	particularly more about my layout changes.
