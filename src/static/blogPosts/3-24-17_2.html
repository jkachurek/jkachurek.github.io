	If you didn't read the first post in my series about developing this blog section of
	my site, check it out below.  After figuring out how to render the body content in general,
	my focus went to figuring out how to dynamically render embedded images.  Since the body
	content <em>is</em> technically raw html, I could theoretically hard code the images.  But
	for the sake of making it easier to find and style images, I wanted to render them from a 
	separate array of image sources.
</p>
<p>
	My first move was to add an array of image source strings to the <code>BlogPost</code>
	object.  I quickly realized that this would prevent me from styling images on a
	case-by-case basis, so I created the <code>BlogImage</code> object.  All this object
	does is render an image given a source and an object containing its other HTML
	attributes.  This object allows me to have complete control over image display within
	blog posts without hard-coding the images.
</p>
<p>
	The next dilemma was figuring out how to parse through the body content and insert
	these images if I am not using HTML for it.  I devised an identifier for images,
	<code>##img[number]##</code>, where <code>[number]</code> is the index of the image
	to be embedded.  I then came up with two methods for replacing these identifiers.
	I liked the first method for its brevity, but I wound up using the second method for
	its clarity.  I plan to benchmark them in the near future to see which one is
	technically more efficient.  Even though I won't be using enough pictures ever to
	noticeably slow things down, I would like to make sure things run as quickly as they can.
</p>
<p>
	The first, shorter method I tried was the following:
</p>
<pre>
this.bodyContent = this.bodyContent
	.split(/#{2}img[0-9]*#{2}/, this.images.length + 1)
	.reduce((prev, cur, index) => {
		return prev + cur + ((this.images[index] && this.images[index].render()) || '') ;
	}, '');
</pre>
<p>
	This method is concise and effective, but it felt a little too unpredictable for my tastes.
	As you can see, it sifts through the body content and splits it on each <code>##img##</code>
	tag.  It then uses the Array <code>reduce()</code> method to re-joing the split up body
	content, adding in an image element in between each segment that was split.  While it is
	effective, I was not a fan of the part that rendered the image itself.  I will explain the
	<code>render()</code> method in a bit, but
	<code>((this.images[index] && this.images[index].render()) || '')</code>
	seemed like it would inevitably run into an error somewhere down the line.
</p>
<p>The second method I tried was this:</p>
<pre>
let matches = bodyContent.match(/#{2}img[0-9]*#{2}/g);
if (!matches) return;
matches.forEach(match => {
	let img: string = match.substr(5);
	let imgIndex: number = (~~img.slice(0, img.length - 2) - 1);
	if (!this.images[imgIndex]) return;
	this.bodyContent = this.bodyContent
		.replace(match, this.images[imgIndex].render());
});
</pre>
<p>
	While this is almost double the amount of lines, it is a little more clear about what it is
	doing, and it doesn't rely on a questionable string of logic operators.  In this method, I
	am using the same regular expression from the first method to instead find an array of matches
	within the body content.  For each match, I parse out the number from that image tag, then
	replace the match with its proper image element.
</p>
<p>
	My final note here will explain how I went about rendering the image element, which is quite
	simple.  Using a <code>render()</code> method was definitely inspired by the dabbling I have done
	with React, which would likely be the ideal solution for this scenario as far as frameworks go,
	but I was also excited to take on this challenge with Angular.  First, I created a separate class
	from <code>BlogPost</code> called <code>BlogImage</code>.  This class would take the source URL of
	the image, then an object of any desired HTML attributes, and use those to assemble an image
	element.  The code for this method was quite simple:
</p>
<pre>
let elementPieces = ['&#60;img', `src="${this.src}"`];
for (var prop in this.attrs) {
	if (this.attrs.hasOwnProperty(prop)) {
		elementPieces.push(`${prop}="${this.attrs[prop]}"`);
	}
}
elementPieces.push('&#62;');
return elementPieces.join(' ');
</pre>
<p>
	Here, we simple create an array of pieces that form the image element by adding the element name, 
	source, and any of the defined attributes to an array, then joining them with spaces.
