  I left off my previous post discussing how I initially plotted out the game logic. Here, I will
  explain how that worked, and also why I wound up completely changing it later on.
</p>
<p>
  As mentioned before, my initial model for <code>PlayerData</code> was as follows:
  <pre>
constructor() { 
  for (var type in ResourceTypes) { 
    this.resources[type] = 0; 
    this.generators[type] = 0; 
    this.multipliers[type] = 1; 
  } 
} 
resources: Object = {}; 
multipliers: Object = {}; 
generators: Object = {}; 
inventory: Object = {}; 
  </pre>
  I definitely didn't intend this to be the final form of the class, but it worked for
  what I needed early on in the game. The first Update method I wrote for the game was
  the following:
  <pre>
Update(): void { 
  for(var type in ResourceTypes) { 
    if (ResourceTypes.hasOwnProperty(type)) { 
      PlayerData.resources[ResourceTypes[type]] +=
        (PlayerData.generators[ResourceTypes[type]]
         * PlayerData.multipliers[ResourceTypes[type]]); 
    } 
  } 
}
  </pre>
</p>
<p>
  So, every time <code>Update()</code> is called, it is incrementing each of the player's
  resources (as defined in the module <code>ResourceTypes</code>) by the current amount
  of the player's generators and multipliers for that resource. This early version of the
  game had it such that rather than adding specific items to a player's inventory, it simply
  added its effects to a running count in the Player Data. So, if you had no generators, then
  you bought two items that generate $1/sec, and one that generates $5/sec,
  <code>PlayerData.generators['MONEY']</code> would equal 7, but we would have no record
  of which items provided this effect.
</p>
<p>
  The original intent of this was to reduce how often the game had to check in on every game
  object instance. This method is technically way more efficient than the current version,
  but it is far, far less extensible. Which is an issue I will approach later. This also
  simplified the logic for adding and removing benefits to the player's inventory.
  It simply incremented the value in PlayerData, then only checked PlayerData each tick.
</p>
<p>
  The major pitfalls of this method are caused by an inability to track which specific
  items are owned. This makes it almost impossible to create more complex benefits and,
  more importantly, define how the player unlocks items. I will go into detail on the item
  unlocking system in a future post, but I wanted the unlocking of other items to be
  determined by a variety of factors, including current inventory of units/locations/etc.
  That pretty much sums up the initial game logic, but stay tuned to the blog for more on
  how I overhauled this game logic in order to create the unlock system.
